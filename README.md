## Features

1. Discretize continuous arrays using a supervised algorithm guided by information value.
2. Many options to guide discretization process:
  - min information value for a split
  - min observation weights in bin
  - min response value weights in a bin
  - maximum number of bins
  - increasing and decreasing monotonicity
  - exception values
3. speed

## Limitations

1. Only binary response variables supported
